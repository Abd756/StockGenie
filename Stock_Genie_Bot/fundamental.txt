A Comprehensive Guide to Fundamental Analysis on the PSX
This guide provides an in-depth framework for analyzing the Pakistan Stock Exchange, moving
beyond basic concepts to explain the 'why' behind each strategy and metric, all within the context of
the Pakistani market.
1. PSX Investment Themes: A Deep Dive
This section defines the core investment themes and provides a granular, sector-by-sector analysis,
justifying why each fits its respective category.
A. Aggressive / Growth Theme
 Definition: The aggressive or growth theme is an investment philosophy centered on
identifying and capitalizing on companies with a high potential for rapid expansion. The
primary objective is capital appreciation—the increase in the stock's market value—rather
than immediate income from dividends. This strategy is inherently tied to a higher risk
profile, as the future growth is a forecast, not a guarantee.
 Rationale on the PSX: In a developing economy like Pakistan, aggressive growth is often tied
to massive infrastructure projects, industrial expansion, and the rise of new sectors.
Investing in this theme is a bet on the country's economic future. The notes' reference to
"targeted growth" means looking for companies that are positioned to benefit from a
national uplift in industrial activity and infrastructure development.
 Key Sectors and Detailed Analysis:
o Cement Sector: This is a textbook example of a cyclical, aggressive industry on the
PSX. Its performance is a direct reflection of Pakistan's economic health.
 Analysis: A detailed analysis goes beyond a simple P/E ratio. An investor
must scrutinize government spending on infrastructure, the health of the
real estate market, and the company's capacity utilization. Look for
companies with ongoing expansion projects or those located near new
development zones. Key metrics to consider include:
 Capacity Utilization: The percentage of a plant's total production
capacity that is being used. High utilization indicates strong demand.
 Cement Despatches: The volume of cement sold, a direct indicator
of demand.
 Pricing Power: The company's ability to raise prices without losing
market share, which is crucial for maintaining margins.
o Steel Sector: The steel sector is another cyclical industry that thrives on economic
growth.
 Analysis: This is a commodity-driven sector. Detailed analysis involves
monitoring global steel prices, the cost of raw materials (like scrap metal
and iron ore), and domestic demand from both public infrastructure
projects and private construction. Companies with more efficient production
processes and a strong distribution network are more likely to outperform.
o Tech Sector: As a hybrid aggressive and export-oriented theme, this sector offers a
compelling growth story.
 Analysis: The notes mention a "volumetric growth of 30-80%." This is a key
metric. An investor should analyze a tech company's ability to secure
international contracts, expand its service offerings, and its client base.
Unlike traditional industries, the value here is in intellectual property, talent,
and scalability. The P/S ratio is often a better tool than the P/E for these
companies.
B. Defensive / Value Theme
 Definition: This theme is the opposite of aggressive growth. It focuses on stability, resilience,
and consistent returns. The objective is to preserve capital and earn a steady income, often
through dividends, with lower volatility. These companies are typically "hard-core," mature
businesses that provide essential goods or services.
 Rationale on the PSX: A defensive strategy is particularly valuable in a market known for its
volatility. The notes’ point about "consistent dividends" acting as a shield is a core principle.
A steady stream of income provides a buffer against market downturns and currency
fluctuations.
 Key Sectors and Detailed Analysis:
o Textile Sector: While an export-oriented sector, its long-standing presence and
stable growth forecast of 7% place it firmly in the defensive category.
 Analysis: A detailed analysis of a textile company involves examining its
export order book, its ability to maintain profit margins despite fluctuating
international demand, and its dividend payout history. Look for companies
with vertical integration (controlling production from raw material to
finished product) as this provides more stable margins.
o Commercial Banks and Insurance Companies: These are classic defensive sectors
because their services are fundamental to the economy.
 Analysis: For banks, beyond P/B, you must analyze their Net Interest Margin
(NIM)—the difference between interest earned on loans and interest paid
on deposits. You should also scrutinize their Non-Performing Loans (NPLs)
to assess asset quality. For insurance companies, look at their underwriting
profit and the return on their investment portfolio.
o Food, Utilities, and Pharmaceuticals: These sectors are defensive because consumer
demand for their products is inelastic.
 Analysis: For food and utilities, analyze their operational efficiency and any
government regulations on pricing. For pharmaceuticals, look at the
strength of their product pipeline and their market share in different
therapeutic areas.
C. Export-Oriented Theme
 Definition: This is a strategic thematic investment designed to provide a hedge against the
depreciation of the Pakistani Rupee. By investing in companies that earn a significant portion
of their revenue in a stable foreign currency (e.g., USD, EUR), investors can protect the value
of their capital.
 Rationale on the PSX: Pakistan's economy has historically been subject to periods of
currency devaluation. The notes' reference to "dollar-denominated sales" and the tax
exemption on such earnings is a critical advantage. This theme allows investors to benefit
from a macroeconomic trend that can be detrimental to companies focused solely on the
domestic market.
 Key Sectors and Detailed Analysis:
o Textiles and Tech: These are the primary export-oriented sectors. Their analysis
overlaps with the Defensive and Aggressive themes, respectively, but with an added
focus on their export revenue streams.
o Analysis: For an export-oriented company, you must look at the percentage of
revenue from international sales. You also need to track the value of the Pakistani
Rupee against major currencies to understand the impact on their profitability.
2. Investment Methods: The Third-Party vs. Direct Approach
Your notes make a crucial distinction between these two methods, each with its own advantages.
 Investment through a Third Party: This is a passive approach, ideal for investors who lack
the time or expertise for direct stock picking.
o Mutual Funds: You delegate investment decisions to a professional fund manager.
The notes mention that returns are tied to the overall market.
o ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds): Your notes correctly point out that these are a
"basket of good shares" that trade like stocks. The key detail is that ETFs have lower
fees than mutual funds, making them a cost-effective way to get diversified
exposure to a specific index or sector.
o Pension/Retirement Funds: These are long-term, managed savings vehicles with a
specific tax advantage, provided you don't withdraw prematurely.
 Direct Stock Market Investment: This is an active approach, where the investor takes full
responsibility for their portfolio.
o Strategy: The notes' focus on a dividend-focused strategy for direct investment is
highly specific to the PSX.
 Capital Protection: The core idea is that even if the stock price is stagnant,
the dividend provides a tangible return. This is a form of "capital protection"
against market volatility. The notes advise not to expect capital appreciation
from these stocks but to "weave" a predictable income stream through
dividends.
3. Detailed Financial Ratios and Their PSX-Specific Application
Here is a more granular explanation of the financial ratios from your notes, tailored to the context of
the PSX.
 Earnings Yield vs. Interest Rate:
o Formula: Earnings Yield = Current Price per ShareEarnings per Share
o Detailed PSX Application: This is arguably the most crucial screening tool. An
investor should always compare the earnings yield of a stock to the prevailing riskfree rate, which is often approximated by the policy rate of the State Bank of
Pakistan. For a stock to be a compelling investment, its earnings yield must be
significantly higher than this risk-free rate to compensate for the market risk. Your
notes are precise here: "A company’s earnings yield… must exceed the interest rate
to justify investment."
 Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Multiple:
o Formula: P/E=Earnings per Share (EPS)Current Market Price per Share
o Detailed PSX Application: The P/E is used to determine if a stock's price is
reasonable relative to its earnings.
 Comparison: The key is comparison. A P/E of 10 for a cement company
might be cheap if its historical average is 15, or it might be expensive if its
competitors are trading at a P/E of 8. The notes mention using "forecasted
PE" from brokerage reports for widely covered stocks like Lucky Cement.
 Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:
o Formula: P/B=Book Value per ShareCurrent Market Price per Share
o Detailed PSX Application: This ratio is highly relevant for asset-heavy sectors like
banks and insurance on the PSX. A P/B ratio below 1 suggests that the market is
valuing the company at less than its net asset value. This can be a sign of a
distressed or undervalued opportunity.
 Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:
o Formula: P/S=Sales per SharePrice per Share
o Detailed PSX Application: This ratio is crucial for the PSX's growing tech sector.
When a company is not yet profitable, its P/E ratio is meaningless. The P/S ratio
allows investors to assess the company's valuation based on its revenue-generating
ability and market presence.
 Price-to-Cash Flow (P/CF):
o Formula: P/CF=Cash Flow per ShareCurrent Market Price
o Detailed PSX Application: Your notes are highly specific in highlighting this ratio's
importance for the energy sector, particularly because of Pakistan's "circular debt"
issue. The P/CF ratio bypasses the accounting profits that may not be backed by real
cash due to delayed payments. A healthy P/CF ratio indicates that the company has
a strong cash position to meet its operational and debt obligations, even if its
reported earnings are misleading.
